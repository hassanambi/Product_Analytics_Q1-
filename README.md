# 📊 Product Analytics – First Quarter Insights

This project simulates a real-world **product analytics workflow** for a digital product after its **first quarter of launch**. It demonstrates how both junior and senior data analysts might approach exploratory analysis, funnel metrics, feature adoption, retention, revenue performance, and user feedback using artificial but realistic data.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Emulate real product analytics for the first 90 days post-launch  
- Practice both junior-level (descriptive) and senior-level (strategic) data questions  
- Visualize product performance using Power BI  
- Showcase data storytelling and stakeholder-ready metrics

## 🧪 Simulated Datasets

The dataset is fully artificial and contains the following tables:

| Table Name       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `users`          | 200 users with attributes like signup date, plan type, acquisition channel, and country |
| `events`         | 3000+ records tracking user actions such as homepage views, feature usage, logins, upgrades |
| `subscriptions`  | Subset of users who subscribed to Pro or Enterprise plans with MRR included |
| `nps_responses`  | 100 Net Promoter Score (NPS) records with score, comment, and submission date |

## 🔍 Analytical Focus Areas

### Tasks 1:
- Basic usage metrics (DAU, MAU)
- Funnel drop-off and conversion
- Top features and event frequency
- Acquisition channel breakdown
- Retention (Week 1) and session frequency

### Tasks 2:
- Retention curve by cohorts
- Feature correlation with retention
- Early-stage LTV vs CAC insights
- NPS-based sentiment segmentation
- Hypotheses for A/B testing

## 📊 Visualizations (Power BI Recommended)

Key visualizations created:
- **KPI cards:** DAU, MAU, MRR, NPS average  
- **User funnel:** Homepage → Signup → Feature Use → Upgrade  
- **Retention curves:** Weekly cohorts  
- **Feature adoption:** Bar charts by usage & plan  
- **NPS score distribution:** With sentiment highlights  

> You can replicate this in Power BI, Tableau, or Python dashboards.
